# membership-website

A multi-purpose website will be created in which content can be consumed behind a paywall, effectively a membership.
The website will have the general pages as well as specific pages such as;
- Payment for e-books, courses and time-restricted access to content (i.e. memberships)
- A forum for the community by the community

Another idea is to put the content behind a limited amount of access clicks per IP address.
For example, a limited amount of 10 pages can be consumed for every month. Thus if the viewer wishes to consume more, a membership has to be taken. 


Also perhaps a mobile applciation shall be created for members to communicate with others and to consume exclusive content
